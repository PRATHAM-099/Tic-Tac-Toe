- The ***turn_decider()*** function determines which player's turn it is based on the number of buttons clicked so far.
- The game board has event handlers for each button to handle the button click event. When a button is clicked, the ***turn_decider()*** function is called to determine the current player's symbol, and the symbol is displayed on the button and the buttons are then disabled.
- If the number of buttons clicked is greater than or equal to 5, the ***check_winner()*** function is called to check if there is a winner for the round.
- The ***check_winner()*** function checks if there is a winner for the current round by checking each row, column, and diagonal of the game board. If there is a winner, a message is displayed, the win count for the corresponding player is incremented.
- The ***necessary_calculations()*** function is called to update the score.
